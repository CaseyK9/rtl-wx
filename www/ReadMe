This folder contains the program's main configuration file, a log file, and several web page files.

- Edit rtl-wx.conf to configure program options
- Edit rtl-wx.htm to cusomize it for your specific sensor configuration

There are two different web sites contained in this folder that can be served by the system web server (apache2 on Raspberry Pi, lighttpd on the R7000).  There's a debugging/monitoring web console that can be accessed through misc/index.htm.  This website uses multiple html and cgi files to interact with the running rtl-wx server program and is meant for debugging only.

Day to day visualization of sensor data is supported through rtl-wx.htm.  rtl-wx.htm reads csv files produced by the server and displays them.  There's no real-time interaction between rtl-wx.htm and the running rtl-wx server.  rtl-wx.htm is a mostly client side webpage that uses 'gets' to the server to read csv files and display them.

Note: misc/header.in is used as a template in src/Makefile to generate misc/header.htm.  This file is used by the debugging web console and has build date and platform name embedded.
