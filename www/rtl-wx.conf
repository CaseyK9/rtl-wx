; RTL-Wx.conf - RTL-Wx Configuration file.
; 
; This file contains configuration settings for the RTL-Wx Home monitor software.
; The file is re-read every 15 minutes (configurable) and changes will automatically
; be picked up by the server.

[Global Settings]

; Sensor Locking (0=disabled, 1=enabled)
;
; Wireless sensors transmit a lock code in each message that acts as a unique
; identifier for the sensor.  This code only changes when the sensor is reset or
; the sensor battery is replaced.
;
; If locking is enabled, the code received in the first message from each sensor
; will be used to lock down the sensor and any messages received from a similar sensor
; (on the same channel) that have a different lock code will be ignored.
; This prevents confusion when multiple of the same sensor type/channel
; are transmitting in close range, such as when a neighbor has the same sensor as you.
; 
; If locking is enabled, you'll need to restart the rtl-wx program or use the web control
; interface to clear lock codes whenever you reset a sensor or replace its battery.
; (See Sensor Information on web control interface).
; 
; Unless you need this feature because of interference from nearby duplicate sensors, 
; it's best to disable it to simplify sensor battery replacement.
;
sensorLockingEnabled=0

; Set the altitude of the atmospheric pressure sensor for converting
; barometric pressure to sealevel barometric pressure
altitudeInFeet=200

; For systems using an OWL energy sensor connected to an oil or gas burner circuit,
; Set the wattage threshold to indicate that the burner is ON. Also set the 
; rate of burner fuel consumption in gallons per hour.
; (This feature is disabled if these  items are commented out)
fuelBurnerOnWattageThreshold=300
fuelBurnerGallonsPerHour=1.0

; reread this config file every n minutes
configFileReadFrequency=15

; Take a new snapshot every n minutes
;   Note that changing this has a big impact.  The server
;   can store 96 historical data samples so if you increase the frequency
;   beyond every 15 mins, the 96 records will not hold a full day's data.
;   Also, the program's data logging logic hasn't been tested with values other than 15 mins.
;   DON'T CHANGE THIS VALUE UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!!
dataSnapshotFrequency=15

; Specify friendly names for weather sensors (put spaces at end of strings for alignment)
; These aliases are only used in the web based debug console.  The rtl-wx.htm web page has
; its own embedded mapping of sensors to names, which will also need customization.

; Setup automatic CSV file data logging.
; Format is csvFile <fname> <SnapshotsBetweenUpdates>
; With a snapshot frequency of 15 minutes SnapshotsBetweenUpdates
; values can be 1,2,3,4,8,12,16,24,36,48,96
; The numeric parameter for this setting is in SNAPSHOTS not minutes.

; Latest near real-time sensor data file. The file has a single
; data record used by the rtl-wx.htm page to set the values
; for the gauges.  Unlike the logging csv files, this file has just
; one-record and is updated frequently so the rtl-wx.htm gauges can
; efficiently show the very latest sensor readings.
; The parameter for this setting is in MINUTES.

; Take a webcam snapshot every n minutes 
; Comment out or set to 0 if you don't have a webcam hooked up.
