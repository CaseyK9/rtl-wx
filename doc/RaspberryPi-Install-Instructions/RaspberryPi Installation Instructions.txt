Installing RTL-Wx on Raspberry Pi
---------------------------------
<Steps 1..7 are to install NOOBS on brand new device only, for existing Pi installation, skip to step 8>
1) Format SD Card using SDFormatter utility
2) Download NOOBS from raspberryPi.org and copy to SD card
3) Insert SD card into Pi and boot with monitor/keyboard
4) Use init menu to create initial config (timezone, ssh, etc)
5) Remove monitor/keyboard and reboot
6) Use PuTTy SSH tool to remotely contact pi (login as: pi password: raspberry
7) Install samba server on pi (only needed to copy files, could download)

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install samba samba-common-bin
sudo vi /etc/samba/smb.conf

 a) Find 'security =' and uncomment or change to 'security = user'
 b) Find '[homes]' and under home directories 
           set 'read only = no'
sudo smbpasswd -a pi (type raspberry twice for password)
sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart


8) Copy rtl-wx folder to Raspberry pi home folder

a) Get rtl-wx software and expand to /home/pi/rtl-wx

wget https://github.com/magellan/rtl-wx/archive/v0.1.0.tar.gz
tar -xvf
mv v0.1.0.tar.gz rtl-wx

NOTE: If you don't need to modify sources, you can use the prebuilt RaspberryPi binary in rtl-wx/bin and skip steps 8b, and 8c.  In this case, copy rtl-wx and rtl-433 from rtl-wx/bin/RaspberryPi to rtl-wx/bin and also copy rtl-wx/bin/RaspberryPi/header.htm to rtl-wx/www/misc/header.htm.

b) Download and build librtlsdr

cd ~
wget https://github.com/steve-m/librtlsdr/archive/v0.5.3.tar.gz
tar -xvf v0.5.3.tar.gz
mv librtlsdr-0.5.3 rtl-wx/src/librtlsdr
cd rtl-wx/src/librtlsdr
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
cd ~/rtl-wx/src

c) Build rtl-wx

cd ~/rtl-wx/src
edit Makefile to make sure Raspberry Pi settings are uncommented and all others are commented out
make clean
make
cd ../bin

Note: If rtl-wx build complains about convenience.h not found, 
      copy from rtl-wx\src\librtlsdr\src\convenience to rtl-wx\src\librtlsdr\include 


9) Install apache2 web server (for local web control see sample sites-available/default file)

sudo apt-get install apache2 -y
sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
  a) Change Document root from /var/www to /home/pi/rtl-wx/www
  b) Edit the second Directory tag to read as follows
	
#  <Directory /var/www/>
<Directory /home/pi/rtl-wx/www/>
		
  Options Indexes MultiViews +ExecCGI
                
  AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
		
  AllowOverride None
		
  Order allow,deny
		
  allow from all
	
</Directory>

sudo vi /etc/apache2/envvars
   - Change APACHE_RUN_USER and APACHE_RUN_GROUP to pi

sudo service apache2 restart

Note: if above is done and cgi scripts don't produce any output, it's probably an
owner/permissions problem when scripts execute rtl-wx.  Check /var/log/apache2/error.log
- The cgi scripts run from the directory /pi/home/rtl-wx/www as user www-usr
- Make sure o+rx permission is set for directories rtl-wx, www, and files as needed.

Finally, there's a rtl-wx web command to reboot the device and this requires root or sudo permission.  To enable the apache user to do a reboot, edit /etc/sudoers using "sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers" to add the following line at the end: www-data ALL = NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot
(Obviously this could have serious security implications, so it's up to you if you want to do this).

10) Install ncftp FTP command line utility
sudo apt-get install proftpd-basic ncftp


11) Webcam setup (Optional)

Tried to get old logitech 3000 webcam to work without success but had success with newer Logitech Webcam C905 using fswebcam utility.

sudo apt-get install fswebcam

to test: fswebcam -r 640x480 webcam.jpg
can also use: fswebcam -r 1280x720 --no-banner webcam.jpg

12) Install NooElec RTL-SDR USB Dongle (rtl2832u w/ R820T)

a) (use apt-get install to install any missing libs)
b) copy rtl-sdr.rules from src/librtlsrc/src folder to /etc/udev/rules.d/15-rtl-sdr.rules (maybe don't need to rename?)

d) blacklist device so kernel doesn't claim it
sudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf
add the following lines:
  blacklist dvb_usb_rtl28xxu
  blacklist rtl2832
  blacklist rtl2830
  blacklist rtl2838
 
sudo reboot

had good  luck with rdl-433 using:
./rtl-433 -f 433810000 -l 7000

(USB SDR dongles seem to have some variation in their crystals so experimenting with freq offsets may help)

13) Edit /etc/rc.local to launch RTL-Wx at startup.

/home/pi/rtl-wx/bin/rtl-wx -w /home/pi/rtl-wx/www&
