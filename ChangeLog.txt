RTL-Wx Home Monitoring software

Version Info and Release

10-08-2014 - v3.1
  - Complete rewrite of rtl-wx.htm to incorporate HighStock charting package and JustGage gauge widgets.
  - Added CSV data logging capability (generated csv files are used by rtl-wx.htm)
  - Added support for Efergy and Owl electricity monitors
  - Added Oil Burner fuel consumption monitoring (uses Owl CM119A electricity sensor on oil burner circuit)
  
07-25-2014 - v2.2
  - Reworked timestamp sructs and tlogic to use C time_t instead of storing min/hour/day/month/year.
  - Added timeout field to sensor info->sensor status output
  
07-23-2014 - Restructured to support DD-WRT
  - Renamed program from SlugWx (PiWx) to RTL-Wx and renamed several support files (eg SlugWx.conf to rtl-wx-conf)
  - Reorganized public folder layout (changed public to www, merged thttp into www)
  - Merged make for main rtl-wx program and for rtl-433 debug program into single Makefile (two targets)
  - Separated embedded librtlsdr files and updated sources from git rtlsdr repo.  This now is built as library in rtl-wx/librtlsdr
  - Fixed bug in sensor naming code (from 07/03) that caused memory corruption (accidental semicolon after for loop)
  - Eliminated legacy wmr9x8 serial port weather station support (now only suports 433mhz USB rtlsdr)
  - Updated Documentation to prepare for release

07-03-2014 - Added ability to name sensors for debug info display (see rtl-wx.conf)
06-28-2014 - Fixed error in SlugWx.htx that caused duplicate sample in graph displays (param 28? duplicated)
 
05-21-2014 - Added support for Raspberry Pi

Legacy Notes  (From old NSLU2 incarnation of program which connected serially to a wmr968 weather station)

SlugWx Weather station monitoring software for the NSLU2

07-11-2011 - Swapped out FtpLib and replaced it with ncFtpPut system call

After persistant hangs in the ftplib ftpConnect() call, I swapped it out and instead am now using
ncFtpPut through a system() call.  It's a tad slower since it does a separate connect/login for each
uploaded file, but it seems to work fine.  

This change is in scheduler.c and also SlugWx.conf.  The SlugWx.conf change was to remove the filename
from the dest path, as the src filename is assumed by ncftpput.  Also, had to do a one time command line
"ipkg install ncftp" to get the ncftp package installed on the Slug.

Also, I commented out a "resetting serial port" printf in scheduler.c.  In the past I've had
problems writing to stdout while in standalone mode (the normal auto-start mode) where the stdout buffer
gets full since there's no stdout open and the code hangs after too many printf calls.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06-04-2010 - Added cumulative rainfall logic to support rainfall per day and per week in web output

The cumulative rainfall logic allows the program to report total rainfall for each day of the past week.

This change required some updates to nearly every file in the project except Util.c and Wm9x8.x

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
02-25-2009 - Changed DPRINTF to remove write to stdout which was causing output buffer to fill
and subsequent writes to hang app.
